## What's it?

It's just a simple database schema and some sample data to demonstrate a technique to display items ordered by relevance and decaying by time.  Much like a democratic forum.


## Does it... do anything?

Yeah.  There are some empty directories for a demo web app project--but the database does work. Make a database, load the schema & data in postgres and query the views.  Tinker away.
